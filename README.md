# Thesis title
hand gesture & sound recognition (Internet Of Things)
### Description
The aim of this project is to control the light of the lamp using the hand gesture & sound recognition technique.
### Example of use
For example, if you show the number one to the camera with your hand, the light of the lamp will increase and if you show the number two, it will decrease.
You can also control the light of the lamp by saying light up and light down.

### Platform
* [Python](#Python)
* [Google Colab](#Google-Colab)
### Why colab?
You will quickly learn and use Google Colab if you know and have used Jupyter notebook before. Colab is basically a free Jupyter notebook environment running wholly in the cloud. Most importantly, Colab does not require a setup, plus the notebooks that you will create can be simultaneously edited by your team members – in a similar manner you edit documents in Google Docs. The greatest advantage is that Colab supports most popular machine learning libraries which can be easily loaded in your notebook.
